      SPAC SPAC SPACA special purpose acquisition company is a blank-check =
company that raises money from investors in an initial public offering, put=
s the money in a pot, and uses the pot to buy a stake in some existing priv=
ate company, merging with that company (in a =E2=80=9Cde-SPAC merger=E2=80=
=9D) and taking it public.=C2=A0Traditionally the SPAC does its IPO at $10 =
per share; if it sells 100 million shares then it will have=C2=A0$1 billion=
 in its pot. It will go out and find a private company and negotiate with i=
t, and the negotiations will be over how big a stake the SPAC gets for its =
money. The SPAC has a billion dollars; it will go to the private company an=
d say, for instance, =E2=80=9Cwe think you are a $4 billion company, if we =
give you $1 billion you=E2=80=99ll be a $5 billion company, so our $1 billi=
on should buy 20% of your stock, so after we merge you should have 500 mill=
ion shares outstanding of which our SPAC shareholders should own=C2=A0100 m=
illion.=E2=80=9D[1] And the company says =E2=80=9Cno we are a $9 billion co=
mpany, if you give us $1 billion we=E2=80=99ll be a $10 billion company, so=
 your $1 billion should buy 10% of our stock, so after we merge we=E2=80=99=
ll have 1 billion shares outstanding of which your SPAC shareholders should=
 own 100 million.=E2=80=9D And then they go from there and hopefully find a=
 compromise price everyone can live with.=C2=A0And there will usually be a =
PIPE, a private investment in public equity, alongside the de-SPAC merger d=
eal: Some big institutional investors will put in new money to buy shares d=
irectly, so that the newly public company raises money not only from the SP=
AC but also from other big institutions. So perhaps the final deal will be =
a $6 billion pre-money valuation plus $1 billion from the SPAC and $1 billi=
on from PIPE investors, for a total valuation of $8 billion; SPAC investors=
 will get about 12.5% of the company (one-eighth, the amount of cash they p=
ut in divided by the total valuation), the PIPE investors will get another =
12.5%, and the existing private shareholders will keep the other 75%.Then t=
hey will announce the deal and hopefully the stock=E2=80=94the SPAC stock, =
which is already public=E2=80=94will trade up. The deal will be well receiv=
ed; investors will think the company is worth more than the agreed valuatio=
n. Perhaps the market will say the company is worth $10 billion, which mean=
s that the SPAC shareholders=E2=80=99 12.5% stake is worth $1.25 billion, w=
hich means that each $10 SPAC share should trade to $12.50.=C2=A0This is th=
e same basic mechanism as a traditional initial public offering. The people=
 who agree to buy a private company=E2=80=99s shares at the moment it becom=
es public  are taking a risk and doing the private company a favor; they ex=
pect to be able to buy those shares at a bit of a discount. After the compa=
ny goes public=E2=80=94in an IPO or a de-SPAC merger=E2=80=94the stock shou=
ld trade up, to reward the initial purchasers. In an IPO this is called the=
 =E2=80=9CIPO pop,=E2=80=9D and it is much  criticized by venture capitalis=
ts. In a SPAC this phenomenon doesn=E2=80=99t exactly have a name, but it o=
bviously exists and is the basis for the current SPAC mania. If investors d=
idn=E2=80=99t think =E2=80=9Cbuying SPAC stock at $10 gives us a ticket to =
get some cool private company at a discount,=E2=80=9D they wouldn=E2=80=99t=
 be excitedly buying SPAC stocks; there would not be a dozen SPACs  going p=
ublic each day, and multiple exchange-traded funds competing to package SPA=
Cs for investors, and generally a ton of excitement for SPACs. (Of course t=
here is no guarantee of anything; some IPOs open below their IPO price, and=
 some SPACs trade down as investors are disappointed by the deals they make=
.[2] But the usual expectation, at least for hot companies=C2=A0in the curr=
ent hot market, is for these things to trade up initially.)The thing about =
SPACs, though,=C2=A0is that shares in the SPAC=E2=80=94the pot of money=E2=

 If you are aware of the basic SPAC-pop dynamic=E2=80=94if you have watched=
 other high-profile SPAC deals get done and their stocks trade up=E2=80=94y=
ou might look at a pre-merger SPAC of a well-known sponsor and say =E2=80=
=9Cwell, this SPAC is just a pot of money, and I don=E2=80=99t know what co=
mpany it is going to merge with, but it=E2=80=99s going to merge with=C2=A0=
some=C2=A0company, and it will get a good price, so after the merger these =
shares will be worth $12.50 or something.=E2=80=9D And so you might be will=
ing to pay, say, $10.50 or $11 or $12 or $12.49 for the SPAC=E2=80=99s shar=
es today, even though today they just represent a claim on $10 worth of cas=
h. You can pre-purchase the =E2=80=9CSPAC pop,=E2=80=9D as it were.=C2=A0Yo=
u could take this logic further. You could say: =E2=80=9CWell, this SPAC is=
 just a pot of money, and I don=E2=80=99t know what company it is going to =
merge with, but I suspect it=E2=80=99s going to be a hot electric-vehicle c=
ompany, and hot electric-vehicle companies have particularly obscene SPAC p=
ops because the market absolutely loves SPACs and EVs right now, so I think=
 that the sponsor will pay $10 for shares that=C2=A0will trade up to $50, s=
o I am going to pay $49.99 for them now.=E2=80=9D You=E2=80=99ll pay $49.99=
 for a pot of cash worth $10. And, to be clear, this can be a perfectly rat=
ional trade: You=E2=80=99re not=C2=A0just=C2=A0buying a $10 pot of cash for=
 $49.99; you=E2=80=99re also buying the high likelihood that that pot of ca=
sh will be used to buy underpriced shares of a hot private electric-vehicle=
 company. The right SPAC can do that, but you can=E2=80=99t do that with $1=
0 in your checking account, so the $10 in the SPAC=E2=80=99s hands really i=
s worth more than $10.But what is the=C2=A0electric-vehicle company to make=
 of all this? A SPAC sponsor comes to the EV company and says =E2=80=9Cwe=
=E2=80=99ll give you $10 per share for your stock, let=E2=80=99s negotiate =
about how much stock that will buy us.=E2=80=9D And then they=C2=A0debate v=
aluations; the company argues it is=C2=A0worth a lot, while the sponsor say=
s it=E2=80=99s=C2=A0worth less. But at some point the company=C2=A0says to =
the sponsor: =E2=80=9CLook, you=E2=80=99re asking to buy our stock at $10 p=
er share, to give it to your shareholders, who paid you $10 per share for i=
t. But I can look on the stock exchange and see that your stock is trading =
at $50 per share right now. I know that, to avoid disappointing your shareh=
olders, you have to get back stock worth $50 for the $10 you put in, and I =
don=E2=80=99t want to sell you stock at an 80% discount.=E2=80=9D It is a f=
air objection. If the EV company sells shares worth, say, $25 to the SPAC, =
and gets back $10 per share, then (1) the EV company is getting kind of rip=
ped off (it=E2=80=99s selling $25 stock for $10), but (2) the SPAC sharehol=

=99s net asset value each day. It=E2=80=99s a pretty easy calculation: You =
take the price of each stock, multiply by the number of shares you own, and=
 add up the results; that gives the NAV of your fund. Then you divide that =
by the number of shares your fund has outstanding, which gives you the NAV =
per share.If someone wants to redeem out of your mutual fund, they come to =
you and hand you their shares, and you hand them back cash equal to the NAV=
. It is very important that you get the NAV right: If your calculation of N=
AV is too high (too low), you will pay redeeming holders too much (too litt=
le) for their shares, meaning that there will be too little (too much) left=
 in your fund for the remaining holders, meaning that you=E2=80=99ll be che=
ating the remaining (redeeming) holders out of their fair share of the valu=

investment under false pretenses.Again, though, it=E2=80=99s pretty easy to=
 calculate the NAV of a stock fund. It=E2=80=99s harder if you own bonds, s=

February 19, 2021, Infinity Q informed the Fund that at such time it was un=

=E2=80=9D to figure out what their stuff is actually worth. Here is how the=
 fund has described=C2=A0its valuation methods:The Fund makes investments i=
n various types of volatility and variance swaps. The Adviser deems vanilla=
 volatility and index barrier variance swaps as Level 2 positions, and comm=
on stock barrier and corridor variance swaps as Level 3 positions in the fa=
ir value hierarchy. The Fund uses a pricing service to model price the vari=
ance swap trades. The pricing service uses quotes from brokers to estimate =
implied volatility levels as an input to these models. A significant change=
 in implied volatility could have a significant impact on the value of a po=
sition.The Fund makes dispersion investments using volatility and variance =
swaps and options on dispersion. The Adviser deems these positions to be il=
liquid and classifies these positions as Level 3 in the fair value hierarch=
y. The Adviser uses model pricing to calculate the fair volatility level fo=
r each leg of the dispersion trade. The Adviser uses quotes from a pricing =
service and brokers to estimate implied volatility levels as an input to th=
ese models. A significant change in implied volatility could have a signifi=
cant impact on the value of a position, and depending on the direction of t=
he change, could either increase or decrease a position's value.The Fund ma=
kes cross-asset correlation investments using correlation and covariance sw=
aps. The Adviser deems these positions to be illiquid and classifies these =
positions as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Adviser uses a third =
party calculation agent to value these positions. The local volatility mode=
l is used to calculate the fair correlation level for correlation swaps. Qu=
otes from a pricing service are used to estimate the implied correlation le=
vels as an input to these models. A significant change in implied volatilit=

advanced talks to settle his lawsuit against the co-working company=E2=80=

 the matter.Under the terms of the potential settlement, SoftBank would pur=
chase half of the WeWork shares it originally agreed to buy in 2019, said o=
ne the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are still p=

tock, and that SoftBank would pay about $1.5 billion overall. The shares ar=

O. Then a pandemic hit, the shares were worth less than SoftBank had agreed=

; if it sells 100 million shares then it will have=C2=A0$1 billion in its p=
ot. It will go out and find a private company and negotiate with it, and th=
e negotiations will be over how big a stake the SPAC gets for its money. Th=
e SPAC has a billion dollars; it will go to the private company and say, fo=
r instance, =E2=80=9Cwe think you are a $4 billion company, if we give you =

 private investment in public equity, alongside the de-SPAC merger deal: So=

, so that the newly public company raises money not only from the SPAC but =
also from other big institutions. So perhaps the final deal will be a $6 bi=

 PIPE investors, for a total valuation of $8 billion; SPAC investors will g=

can do that, but you can=E2=80=99t do that with $10 in your checking accoun=

 what is the=C2=A0electric-vehicle company to make of all this? A SPAC spon=

ess. But at some point the company=C2=A0says to the sponsor: =E2=80=9CLook,=
 you=E2=80=99re asking to buy our stock at $10 per share, to give it to you=
r shareholders, who paid you $10 per share for it. But I can look on the st=
ock exchange and see that your stock is trading at $50 per share right now.=
 I know that, to avoid disappointing your shareholders, you have to get bac=
k stock worth $50 for the $10 you put in, and I don=E2=80=99t want to sell =
you stock at an 80% discount.=E2=80=9D It is a fair objection. If the EV co=
mpany sells shares worth, say, $25 to the SPAC, and gets back $10 per share=
, then (1) the EV company is getting kind of ripped off (it=E2=80=99s selli=

le=3D"font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0;">If you run=
 a mutual fund, and you own a bunch of stocks, you calculate your fund=E2=
=80=99s net asset value each day. It=E2=80=99s a pretty easy calculation: Y=
ou take the price of each stock, multiply by the number of shares you own, =
and add up the results; that gives the NAV of your fund. Then you divide th=
at by the number of shares your fund has outstanding, which gives you the N=
AV per share.</p><p style=3D"font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; mar=
gin: 1em 0;">If someone wants to redeem out of your mutual fund, they come =
to you and hand you their shares, and you hand them back cash equal to the =
NAV. It is very important that you get the NAV right: If your calculation o=
f NAV is too high (too low), you will pay redeeming holders too much (too l=
ittle) for their shares, meaning that there will be too little (too much) l=
eft in your fund for the remaining holders, meaning that you=E2=80=99ll be =
cheating the remaining (redeeming) holders out of their fair share of the v=
alue. Also of course the=C2=A0<em>performance=C2=A0</em>of your fund is jus=
t the track record of changes in NAV; if you calculate a NAV that is too hi=
gh then your fund will look like it performed better than it did, and you w=

=99s current portfolio includes swap instruments (the =E2=80=9CSwaps=E2=80=
=9D) for which Infinity Q calculates fair value using models provided by a =
third-party pricing vendor. As of February 18, 2021, the Fund=E2=80=99s rep=
orted NAV was derived using a valuation for these Swaps that resulted in th=

in: 1em 0;">On February 18, 2021, based on information learned by the Commi=
ssion staff and shared with Infinity Q, Infinity Q informed the Fund that I=
nfinity Q=E2=80=99s Chief Investment Officer had been adjusting certain par=
ameters within the third-party pricing model that affected the valuation of=
 the Swaps. On February 19, 2021, Infinity Q informed the Fund that at such=
 time it was unable to conclude that these adjustments were reasonable, and=
, further, that it was unable to verify that the values it had previously d=
etermined for the Swaps were reflective of fair value. Infinity Q also info=
rmed the Fund that it would not be able to calculate a fair value for any o=
f the Swaps in sufficient time to calculate an accurate NAV for at least se=
veral days. Infinity Q and the Fund immediately began the effort to value t=
hese Swap positions accurately to enable the Fund to calculate an NAV, whic=
h effort includes the retention of an independent valuation expert. However=
, Infinity Q and the Fund currently believe that establishing and verifying=
 those alternative methods may take several days or weeks. Infinity Q and t=
he Fund are also determining whether the fair values calculated for positio=
ns other than the Swaps are reliable, and the extent of the impact on histo=
rical valuations. As a result, the Fund was unable to calculate an NAV on F=
ebruary 19, 2021, and it is uncertain when the Fund will be able to calcula=
te an NAV that would enable it to satisfy requests for redemptions of Fund =
shares.</p><p style=3D"font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1=

urrent and former shareholders of the Fund is to liquidate the Fund in a re=
asonable period of time, determine the extent and impact of the historical =
valuation errors, and return the maximum amount of proceeds to such shareho=
lders. Relief permitting the Fund to suspend redemptions and postpone the d=
ate of payment of redemption proceeds with respect to redemption orders rec=
